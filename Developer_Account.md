# Developer Account Application

NOTE: After submitting the application, it can take days to weeks for Twitter to approve. It is strongly recommended that you submit the application as soon as you sign up the workshop. Without the twitter developer account and the credentials associated with the account, you won't be able to pull data from twitter.

1. A twitter developer account is associated with the twitter account of the user. Thus you need a twitter account before application.

2. Log in [here](developers.twitter.com), - Apply for a Developer Account

3. There are three levels of developer accounts that comes with no charge: Essential, Elevated, Academic Research. Each has its requirement for applicants, please read and apply based on your situation. The Academic Research offers the maximum amount of tweets and flexibility.

There are a few questions that you need to answer:

1. In your words: In English, please describe how you plan to use Twitter data and/or APIs. For students and teachers, please include the name of the school, the name of the instructor and the course number (if available). The more detailed the response, the easier it is to review and approve.

> Answer for reference: I'm hosting a workshop to introduce how to use twitter developer account to pull data through twitter API. Participants (mostly undergraduate and graduate students) will learn how to pull data for their research, and applying text analysis and NLP model to do sentiment analysis.

2. Are you planning to analyze Twitter data?
> Answer for reference: Yes

3. Please describe how you will analyze Twitter data including any analysis of Tweets or Twitter users.
> Answer for reference: The data will first be collected and stored in the local disk. Then the data will be parsed into dataframe, I will use NLP model(e.g. BERT) to embed the words, and run sentiment analysis.

4. Will your app use Tweet, Retweet, like, follow, or Direct Message functionality?
> Answer for reference: Yes, but only for personal purpose.

Note this question is asking whether you will use the API to post tweets, retweet, like tweet(s), follow user and send direct messages to other users. You can answer No if you would not like to use.

5. Please describe your planned use of these features.
> Answer for reference: I will explore these features to post tweets, like tweets as an alternative to regular posting and liking.

6. Do you plan to display Tweets or aggregate data about Twitter content outside of Twitter?
> Answer for reference: Yes

7. Please describe how and where Tweets and/or data about Twitter content will be displayed outside of Twitter.

8. Will your product, service or analysis make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity?
> Answer for reference: No

Note: Twitter is very strict about sharing data with any government entity, if you plan to make the acquired data and any deriving analysis available to any government entity, please explain in greatest detail.
